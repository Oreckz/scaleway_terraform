# scaleway_terraform

A reusable module for creating standalone instances on the Scaleway platform. 

`main.tf` contains the provider configuration and example usage of the module.
It is highly suggested that you use a `terraform.tfvars` file to set your values or these
can be passed at runtime using the `-var` flag.
